QUESTION PRACTICE


1. set up basic logging to a file `basic.log` with level INFO.  
   write one debug, one info, one warning, one error message.  
   open the file and see which lines actually appeared.

2. create a logger named "shop" with level DEBUG.  
   add one file handler "shop.log" and one stream handler (console).  
   log messages at debug, info, warning, error levels.  
   see what shows in console vs file.

3. make a logger that only shows ERROR and CRITICAL in console,  
   but saves DEBUG and INFO to file `detailed.log`.  
   test with 5 different log calls.

4. create one logger that writes:  
   - all messages to `all_logs.log`  
   - only WARNING and higher to `warnings.log`  
   - INFO and higher to console  
   log 6 messages at different levels and check both files + console.

5. set up a logger with three handlers:  
   - console (INFO+)  
   - `debug.log` (DEBUG+)  
   - `errors.log` (ERROR+)  
   add a custom format with logger name and thread name.  
   log debug, info, error messages.

6. make a logger that logs to console (INFO) and to two files:  
   `info.log` (INFO only)  
   `error.log` (ERROR+)  
   test by logging info, warning, error.

7. write a function `divide(a, b)` that logs:  
   - debug: entering with a and b  
   - info: result if success  
   - error: division by zero  
   call it twice (valid + zero) and check log file.

8. create a decorator `log_call` that logs:  
   function name + arguments before call  
   result after call  
   apply it to a simple function `add(a, b)` and call it.

9. make a logger for a fake "app" with rotating file handler (new file every 5 seconds or 100 bytes – for testing).  
   log 10 messages quickly and see if it creates multiple files.

10. create two separate loggers: "ui" and "database".  
    give "ui" console handler (INFO)  
    give "database" file handler `db.log` (DEBUG)  
    log from both and see separation.

11. set up logging with:  
    console (WARNING+)  
    file `app.log` (INFO+)  
    another file `critical.log` (CRITICAL only)  
    log messages so each place gets different content.

12. write a small script that:  
    logs start of program (INFO)  
    tries to open a non-existing file → catch exception and log ERROR with exception info  
    logs end of program (INFO)  
    use `exc_info=True` in error log.
