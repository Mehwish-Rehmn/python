QUESTION Practice

Iterators (questions 1–4)

1. Make a class `ReverseList` that takes a list in `__init__`  
   and lets you loop over it in reverse order using `for` loop.  
   (Hint: use `__iter__` and `__next__`)

   Example:

   r = ReverseList([10, 20, 30, 40])
   for x in r:
       print(x)   # 40 30 20 10
  
2. Create a class `EvenNumbers` that starts from 0 and gives even numbers forever.  
   Use it like:

   evens = EvenNumbers()
   print(next(evens))  # 0
   print(next(evens))  # 2
   print(next(evens))  # 4


3. Take any list and make an iterator that only gives even-indexed items (0, 2, 4…).  
   Example:

   it = EvenIndex(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
   print(list(it))   # ['a', 'c', 'e']


4. Make an iterator `Countdown(n)` that counts down from n to 1.  
   After 1 it should raise StopIteration.

### Generators (questions 5–8)

5. Write a generator function `countdown(n)` that yields numbers from n down to 1.  
   Use it in a for loop and also with next().

   for num in countdown(5):
       print(num)  


6. Create a generator `fibonacci()` that gives fibonacci numbers forever (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…).  
   Print first 10 numbers using next() or for loop.

7. Make a generator expression (with parentheses) that gives squares of even numbers from 0 to 20.  
   Then convert it to list and print.

8. Write a generator `read_lines(filename)` that reads a text file line by line and yields each line (stripped).  
   Use it to print only lines longer than 10 characters.

### Decorators (questions 9–12)

9. Make a decorator `greet` that prints "welcome!" before and "thank you!" after any function runs.
   @greet
   def say_hi(name):
       print(f"hi {name}")

   say_hi("wish")
   # welcome!
   # hi mehwish
   # thank you!


10. Write a decorator `twice` that runs the function two times automatically.

    @twice
    def shout():
        print("hello!!")

    shout()
    # hello!!
    # hello!!


11. Make a decorator `timer` that prints how many seconds the function took to run.

    @timer
    def slow():
        time.sleep(1.5)
        print("done")

    slow()
    # done
    # slow took 1.502 seconds


12. Create a decorator `only_if_logged_in` that checks if a dictionary `user` has `"logged_in": True`.  
    If not → print "please login" and don’t run the function.  
    If yes → run the function.

    @only_if_logged_in
    def see_profile(user):
        print(f"hello {user['name']}")

    see_profile({"name": "mwsh", "logged_in": True})   
    see_profile({"name": "guest", "logged_in": False})
