QUESTION PRACTICE

### conditional statements (if/elif/else) 

1. take a number from user. print "positive" if number > 0, otherwise print "not positive"
2. take age from user. print "adult" if age >= 18, else print "minor"
3. take a number. print "even" if number % 2 == 0, else print "odd"
4. take marks (0–100). print "pass" if marks >= 40, else "fail"
5. take temperature. if > 30 print "hot", if between 15–30 print "normal", else "cold"
6. take character. print "vowel" if it is a,e,i,o,u (lowercase only), else print "consonant"
7. take three numbers. print the largest one
8. take year. print "leap year" if divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also by 400
9. take side1, side2, side3. check if they can form a triangle (sum of any two sides > third side)
10. take salary. calculate tax:  
    - 0 if salary ≤ 300000  
    - 5% if 300001–600000  
    - 10% if 600001–900000  
    - 15% if > 900000  
    print tax amount
11. take three angles of triangle. print "equilateral", "isosceles", "scalene" or "not a triangle"
12. take day number (1–7). print day name ("monday" for 1, "sunday" for 7), else "invalid day"

### loops 

1. print numbers from 1 to 10 using for loop
2. print "hello" 5 times using while loop
3. print even numbers from 2 to 20 using for loop
4. take n from user. print sum of numbers from 1 to n (using loop)
5. take n. print multiplication table of n from 1 to 10
6. using while loop: keep asking user for number until they enter 0, then print "stopped"
7. print first 10 fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...)
8. take n. count how many digits are in n (using while loop)
9. take string. count how many vowels are in it using for loop
10. take number n. check if it is prime (print "prime" or "not prime")
11. using nested for loop: print this pattern (5 rows)  
    *  
    **  
    ***  
    ****  
    *****
12. using while loop: find reverse of a number  
    example: input 1234 → output 4321
