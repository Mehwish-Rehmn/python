## practice questions on importing modules/packages + virtual environments**  


1. Create a file called utils.py.
Inside it, write a function double(n) that returns n * 2.
In main.py, import the whole module and print the result of double(10)

2. In the same utils.py, add a variable:
author = "coder"
Now in main.py, import only the variable author and print it.

3. Create a folder named helpers.
Inside it:
- Add an empty __init__.py file
- Create a file greet.py
- Inside greet.py, create a function hello(name)
In main.py, import hello from helpers.greet and call it with your own name.

4. Write the exact terminal command to create a virtual environment named venv-learn using Python’s built-in `venv` module.

5. After activating venv-learn, write the command to install these two packages:
- requests
- python-dotenv

6. After installing the packages, write the command to generate a requirements.txt file with exact frozen versions.

7. You receive a project folder that already contains a requirements.txt file.
   After creating and activating a new virtual environment, what command will you run to install all dependencies?

8. Create a file colors.py with this list:
python
rainbow = ["red","orange","yellow","green","blue","indigo","violet"]
In main.py, import rainbow and print only the colors that start with the letter `"b"`.

9. Create a package named tools with:
- calc.py: function `power(base, exp)`
- text.py: function `shout(txt)`
Modify __init__.py so that in main.py you can write:
from tools import power, shout

10. Create this structure:
mylib/
├── __init__.py
├── mathf.py     (add(a,b), multiply(a,b))
└── fmt.py       (capitalize(s))
Modify __init__.py so that you can directly write:
from mylib import add, capitalize
without importing from submodules manually.
