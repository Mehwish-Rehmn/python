### functions


1. create a function called greet that prints "hello everyone" when called
2. create a function called add_two that takes two numbers and prints their sum
3. create a function called say_name that takes one parameter (name) and prints "hi name!"
4. create a function called is_even that takes a number and returns True if even, False if odd
5. create a function called square that takes a number and returns its square
6. create a function called max_of_two that takes two numbers and returns the bigger one
7. create a function called calculate_total that takes three numbers (price, quantity, discount)  
   discount is in percent (example 10 for 10%)  
   return final amount after discount
   
9. create a function called reverse_string that takes a string and returns it backwards  
   (do not use [::-1], use loop)

10. create a function called factorial that takes a positive integer n and returns n!  
    (example: 5! = 120)  
    use recursion or loop (your choice)

11. create a function called find_common that takes two lists and returns a new list with items that appear in both lists  
    (do not use set, use loop)

12. create a function called is_prime that takes a number and returns True if it is prime, False otherwise  
    (prime = only divisible by 1 and itself, numbers > 1)

13. create a function called fibonacci that takes n and prints first n fibonacci numbers  
    (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...)
Try to write each function with:
- proper def line
- good parameter names
- return when needed
- some test calls below the function
# example format you can follow:
def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
print(is_even(10))   # True
print(is_even(7))    # False

### lambda, map(), filter()

1. use map + lambda to double every number in [1, 3, 5, 7]  
2. use filter + lambda to keep only odd numbers from [2, 4, 7, 9, 12]  
3. use map + lambda to make all strings uppercase: ["hi", "python", "code"]  
4. use filter + lambda to keep numbers > 0 from [-5, 3, -2, 8, 0]  
5. use map + lambda to add 100 to each item in [10, 20, 30]  
6. use filter + lambda to keep strings longer than 4 chars: ["cat", "tiger", "dog", "lion"]  
7. use map + lambda + two lists: multiply [1,2,3] with [10,20,30]  
8. use filter + map: first keep > 10 from [5,12,8,15,3], then add 5 to each  
9. use filter + map: keep words starting with "s" from ["sun", "rain", "snow", "wind"], then make uppercase  
10. filter even numbers from range(1,21), then map to their square, convert to list
