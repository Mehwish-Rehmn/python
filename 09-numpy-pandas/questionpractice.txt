QUESTION PRACTICE

(pandas + numpy + matplotlib)

1. create a pandas dataframe with columns: name, age, salary.  
   use numpy to fill salary with random numbers between 30000 and 120000.  
   plot a bar chart (matplotlib) of average salary.

2. make a pandas series with 100 random numbers (numpy normal distribution, mean=50, std=15).  
   use matplotlib histogram to show the distribution.

3. load any small csv (or make one) with date column.  
   convert date to datetime.  
   plot line chart of some value over time using matplotlib.

(pandas manipulation + visualization)

4. create dataframe with columns: city, sales, month.  
   group by city and month, get sum of sales.  
   use seaborn lineplot to show sales trend per city.

5. make dataframe with temperature and humidity (numpy random).  
   create new column "comfort" = 0.7*temperature + 0.3*humidity.  
   use seaborn scatterplot (hue by comfort > 25).

6. take any dataframe, filter rows where one column > average.  
   use seaborn boxplot to compare that column by another category.

(seaborn + pandas tricks)

7. use seaborn built-in "tips" dataset.  
   make violin plot of total_bill by day, split by smoker.  
   add title and change palette to "muted".

8. use seaborn "iris" dataset.  
   make pairplot with hue="species".  
   save the figure as png.

9. create dataframe with sales by product and region.  
   use pandas pivot_table to make summary table.  
   show it as seaborn heatmap with annotations.

10. generate numpy 2d array (random 10×10).  
    turn it into pandas dataframe.  
    plot seaborn heatmap with coolwarm cmap and numbers inside.

real-world style

11. make dataframe with date, sales, city.  
    resample sales to weekly sum (pandas).  
    plot seaborn lineplot of weekly sales, hue by city.

12. create random data: age, income, spending score (numpy).  
    use seaborn regplot to show relationship between age and income.  
    add scatter points with hue=spending score.
